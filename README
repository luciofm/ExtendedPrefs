ExtendedPreferences for Android
===============================

This is an Extended SharedPreferences class for Android.

It adds support for more complex data, storing it in JSON.

It has the same interface of the Native SharedPreferences
(in fact, it relies on SharedPreferences), and adds some new
methods.

The ExtendedPrefsEditor is the editor used to save ExtendedPrefs.
It has the abillity to automatically call the BackupManager to
backup data to the cloud.

The motivation for this project is that I need more complex Preferences,
and still be able to backup the data with the BackupManager, thats why I
avoid using an SQLITE database to handle these configurations.

It is in earlies stages and is not tested at all yet.
More methods and documentation will come.
